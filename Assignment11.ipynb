    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read mode): This mode is used to open a file for reading only. If the file does not exist, an error will be raised. \n",
    "This is the default mode if no mode is specified. Example: file = open('file.txt', 'r').\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "If the file already exists, it will be truncated (i.e., all the existing content will be deleted) before writing to it. Example: file = open('file.txt', 'w').\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. \n",
    "If the file already exists, the new data will be appended to the end of the file without overwriting the existing data. Example: file = open('file.txt', 'a').\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing, but only if the file does not already exist.\n",
    "If the file already exists, an error will be raised. Example: file = open('file.txt', 'x').\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, which means that the file will be read or written as a binary stream of bytes. \n",
    "This mode can be used with any of the above modes by appending 'b' to the mode string. Example: file = open('file.txt', 'wb').\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (Text mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which means that the file will be read or written as a text stream of characters.\n",

    "\"\"\" Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file? \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# ans\n",
    "\"\"\" In Python, close() function is used to close a file object after it has been opened using the open() function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why it is important to close a file using the close() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Saving Data: If you have written data to a file object but haven't closed it, the data may not be saved to the disk.\n",
    "Calling close() ensures that all data is flushed to the disk, so that it can be accessed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Memory Optimization: If you open a large number of file objects without closing them, your program can quickly run out of memory. \n",
    "By closing file objects when they are no longer needed, you can free up system resources and optimize memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Avoiding Data Corruption: If a file is not properly closed and you try to reopen it later, you may encounter data corruption or other errors.\n",
    "By closing the file when you are done with it, you ensure that the file is in a consistent state and can be safely opened and read later.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Accessing Files from Other Programs: If you don't close a file, other programs may not be able to access it. \n",
    "This is because the operating system may still consider the file to be in use by your program, even if you are no longer actively reading or writing to it.\n",
    "Closing the file releases any locks on the file, making it available for other programs to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the close() function is an important tool for ensuring that file operations are performed correctly and safely.\"\"\""
